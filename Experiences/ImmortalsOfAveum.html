                <h2>Combat</h2>
                <p>
                    My focus while working on the combat systems was to work with combat designers to prototype and build major bosses (including the Exalted Construct, Sandarkk (final boss), and Morbane).
                    Our combat system was based upon Unreal Engine's "Gameplay Ability System" framework so I was able to gain a deep understanding of all of its systems and features, building upon what I'd learned from working on "Blood for Blood" and "ROOT".
                    I fixed bugs in major systems including AI (Behavior Trees), Motion Correction (Attack Animation Adjustment), Recoil, and Combat Ability flow.
                    I also architected and implemented a difficulty system used throughout the game to tune enemy difficulty
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I completely reworked and rearchitected our Encounter system (responsible for AI enemy spawning). I refactored the entire system into its own plugin,
                    breaking the tight connections it had to our other systems. I added major features for designers allowing them more extensibility and expressiveness while improving
                    performance of the system by implementing a better preloading system and throttling/pooling of spawned enemies. I also completely reworked the debugging tools,
                    implementing a fully featured Gameplay Debugger category. Finally, I made save/load of the system more robust by reworking handoffs and suspend/resume of encounters.

                <h2>Level Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of the project many systems needed help to become bug free and performant. I completely reworked the quest breadcrumb algorithm with a focus on improved performance and consistent player experience.
                    I fixed major bugs in our Walk-and-Talk, Conversation, and Farcall systems. And I worked closely with Level Designers, helping them use features and fixing bugs in all previously mentioned systems.
