                    This project was a collaboration between my roommate and me that we produced in 48 hours (with very little sleep). I did a lot of the level design and core system architecture for the project.
                    One of the biggest challenges while working on this project was making the core game loop fun. From the start, the premise of changing the level
                    can seem over powered. The system I made for altering parts of the level on a grid system was key to controlling what the player was able to do. 
                    To the left you can see an example of moving hazrds out of the way in order to complete the level.

                    Speaking of hazards, I also implemented the hazards including the laser and spikes. The laser was the more fun element to implement scince
                    there was a lot more gameplay logic that needed to get completed in order for it to feel fair. I spent a lot of time designing the visuals and
                    sound effects to make it easy to predict when the laser was going to fire without having to keep your eye on the counter the entire level. I think the idea
                    of the game is cool, I just wish we could have explored it more thoroughly.
