                    My biggest contributions to this project was the level design and gameplay programming. 
                    I designed a lot of the intermediate to hard levels which were a great place for
                    us to explore all of the possibilities of the unique mechanics we had come up with. One of the
                    common favorite levels commons at the start of the second world of the game is shown to the left.
                    Up until that point in the game, when Mogu and the box were interacting they largely had the same gravity.
                    The idea of them having different gravities when interacting was an idea I had wanted to explore from the very start,
                    and I was very happy when seeing player reaction to this level as they had the epiphany moment that I look
                    for when designing puzzles.

                    Coincidentally, I was also the designer who initially suggested adding boxes and buttons to the game as I could see 
                    this interaction becoming interesting. Therefore, I did a lot of the initial programming on making sure that interactions between Mogu,
                    boxes, and buttons worked correctly. You can get some really intersting things to happen which we didn't have time to explore fully when boxes
                    and Mogu are falling in different directions including "box flying". There are tons of other levels like this in the game that hopefully
                    inspired moments of realization in the player as we reveal new ways for these simple mechanics to interact.
