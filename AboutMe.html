                <p>Hello! My name is Robert Keller, a programmer, game developer, and musician from Michigan.
                    Programming is my passion, and through it I am able to explore many intersting topics. 
                    The activity that got me hooked on the addiction that is coding was high-school robotics.
                    Being able to write code and immediately see its results in the physical world was extraordinarily rewarding.
                    Robotics consumed every hour that wasn't already devoted to school during the season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another passion of mine is video games. I love to play them and I love to make them.
                    Making games combines my love for story-telling with my passion for programming.
                    Creating a mechanic that is satisfying to use or a puzzle that is intersting to solve is what I strive for.
                    Seeing someone play your game and truly have fun is just as rewarding as driving the robot that I programmed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, I have been playing piano since I was little. It proves to be one of
                    the best ways to relax and unwind after a long day. I play everything from 15th century classical
                    to modern jazz. I also like to experiment with software synthesizers which allows me to combine
                    my technical side with my music.
                </p>
